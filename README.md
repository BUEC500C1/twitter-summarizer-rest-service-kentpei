# Homework part
1. How many API calls you can handle simultaneously and why?  
I call one API Tweepy.  
2. For example, run different API calls at the same time?  
I think I can run defferent API calls at the same time.
3. Split the processing of an API into multiple threads?
I split the process to 3 threads.
